LINGUANA - HACKATHON DEMO SCRIPT
=================================

DEMO DURATION: 5-7 minutes
TARGET AUDIENCE: Judges, investors, technical evaluators

OPENING (30 seconds)
====================
"Hi, I'm [Name], and I'm excited to present Linguana - a PWA platform that's revolutionizing how we preserve and learn Kenyan dialects like Sheng, Kiamu, and Kibajuni, while rewarding contributors with USDC on Base L2.

The problem: These dialects are underrepresented in AI/ML datasets, making it hard to build speech recognition systems for millions of Kenyans. Traditional data collection is expensive and slow.

Our solution: Gamified crowdsourcing that pays contributors in crypto for validated audio contributions."
